          Legal Disclaimers and Disclosures (Footer) Allowed Trading Our
          platform allows simulated trading of cryptocurrency pairs only.
          Trading of actual cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, options, futures,
          or other financial instruments is not provided nor permitted in our
          program. Challenge Success Rate Historical data shows that less than
          3% of participants successfully complete our trading challenges. While
          we maintain strict evaluation standards, success in our simulation
          does not guarantee success in live trading. Simulation Limitations In
          alignment with Canadian consumer protection standards and financial
          services best practices, our trading simulation platform has inherent
          limitations. Results are from simulated trading only and do not
          represent actual cryptocurrency trading. Performance in our challenges
          does not guarantee similar results in live trading. Risk Warning
          Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk and is not suitable
          for all investors. Market volatility can be extreme, prices can move
          rapidly, and technical issues can affect trading. Past performance
          does not guarantee future results. Prohibited Conduct To maintain
          program integrity, any gambling behavior, exploitation of the
          simulation environment, or violation of our terms will be reviewed. We
          reserve the right to delete trading days, reset accounts, terminate
          participation, or ban users from our platform. Educational Purpose Our
          platform is designed for skill development, strategy testing, and
          performance evaluation. All content and services provided are for
          simulation and educational purposes only. Â©2024 [coinprop.io]. All
